## About this project?

Cookie Monster is a website that sells a variety of cookies. Our main purpose is to introduce a new method of buying our cookies, which is by using an online ordering system. This system will help our customers easily to buy our cookies. They will buy our cookies online and pay for it online. When free just come and pick up at our store. 
An online food ordering system is software that enables any businesses to accept and manage online orders. The online ordering system that we are proposing simplifies the ordering process significantly for both the customer and the shop. Customers just only place an order on the website, wait for the purchase to be prepared, and then pick it up at the shop. Customers no longer have to wait in line at the cookie store. The system provides an interactive and up-to-date menu that clearly displays all available options.
